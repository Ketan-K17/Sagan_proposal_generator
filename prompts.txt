Our research project aims to determine precise orbital trajectories of asteroids in our solar system. We're developing advanced computational methods and algorithms to improve asteroid tracking and prediction. Our sophisticated system processes astronomical observations from various sources to calculate accurate orbital parameters, accounting for subtle forces like solar radiation pressure and the Yarkovsky effect. Key challenges include developing robust statistical methods, implementing advanced orbit determination algorithms, and creating a comprehensive database. We're combining classical orbital mechanics with modern computational techniques, including machine learning. The project will deliver practical tools for the astronomical community and has significant implications for planetary defense and solar system dynamics understanding.
